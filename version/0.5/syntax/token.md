Token Header
============

The Token Header is _optional_ and has the same structure in all three Morphologies.

The Token Header must be a JSON `array`. The `array` must have either one or two `elements`.

The Token Header is a Protocol-Level header, meaning that only Engines should set and use its content.

Transaction ID
--------------

The first `element`, if present, must be a JSON `string` containing some form of [Universally Unique Identifier](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122). The Transaction ID must be generated by the Engine that first received the Dispatch in its object form, if a Callback is provided with the Dispatch. This Transaction ID will allow this or Remote Engines to match the corresponding Answer Dispatches. Any value set to the Token Header by Emitters will be discarded.

**TODO: GENERATE THE ANSWER BIND** 

Triggering ID
--------------

The second `element`, if present, must also be a JSON `string` containing some form of Universally Unique Identifier. A Triggering ID must be generated by the Engine for each triggered endpoint in the Subscription Table, _only if_ the Dispatch that triggered the endpoint bears a Transaction ID. 

**THIS WORKS ONLY ON LOCALHOST**
