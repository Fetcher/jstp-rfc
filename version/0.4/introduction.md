Introduction
============


JSTP is a communication protocol designed to:

- Facilitate distributed computing with an abstract, high level API inspired in HTTP
- Standarize interactions among applications connecting with different roles either as clients or servers

JSTP is also designed to be up to the paradigm of modern applications:

- JSTP is JSON, which makes it trivial to parse in modern programming languages.
- The API closely resembles REST, so is very natural to adopt for web developers.
- Responses are sent asynchronously, thus making it fit for parallel processing.
- Messages ( _dispatches_ ) are symmetrical, so every node manages resources with the same API, whether is a server or a client node.
- Supports subscription ( _binding_ ) to events on remote hosts.
- Supports seamless reflective message processing.
- Arbitrary headers can be added with little to no hassle, making it easy to extend.

Example
-------

How does a regular JSTP Dispatch looks like?

```javascript
{
  "protocol":   ["JSTP", "0.4"],      // The protocol and version
  "method":     "GET",                // The method. Headers are case-insensitive but is customary to user uppercase
                                      // in this one after the HTTP convention
  "resource":   ["foods", "pizza"],   // The selected resource which is to be retrieved (since the method is GET)
  "timestamp":  1365647440759,        // The milliseconds since the 1970-01-01 00:00:00.000 (also known as the UNIX timestamp)
  "token":      ["3434h5098asr34h3"], // [optional] Just some id which the server will probably use to identify this request
  "host":       ["pizza.com.ar"],     // [optional] The destination host to which the Dispatch is to be sent
  "body":       {                     // [optional] A message body
    "message": "Let the cheese melt!"       
  }
}
```

### Subscription example

A subscription Dispatch looks slightly different:

```javascript
{
  "protocol":   ["JSTP", "0.4"],
  "method":     "BIND",               // I bind myself to this event
  "endpoint": {                       // The endpoint header carries a pattern which represents possible Dispatches
    "method":   "POST",               // The type of dispatches I'd like to subscribe to. It can be replaced with a wilcard (*)
    "resource": ["foods", "*"]        // The resource. The second element is a wildcard representing "anything"
  },
  "timestamp":  1365647440759,
  "token":      ["3434h5098asr34h3"],
  "host":       ["pizza.com.ar"]      // The host is still optional. I can perfectly subscribe for dispatches 
                                      // issued in this very engine  
}
```

### Exception example

A low level, exception Dispatch:

```javascript
{
  "protocol":   ["JSTP", "0.4"],
  "timestamp":  1365647440759,
  "token":      ["3434h5098asr34h3"],
  "exception": {                      // The exception header contents the information about the error
    "code": 400,                      // The status code. Shamelessly the same as the HTTP ones
    "message": "Bad Dispatch"         // A description the error
  }
}
```

Notation
--------

JSTP Dispatches are designed from the bottom up to be as compatible with current industry standards as possible. That's why they can be represented as URLs. They can also be represented in a similar fashion to HTTP Requests. These notations are not normative and may not be supported in actual implementations.

### URL

The first sample Dispatch may be represented as an URL like this:

    jstp://pizza.com.ar/foods/pizza

This notation is useful to quickly build JSTP Dispatches from user input, as writing down the JSON by hand can be quite a burden.

### HTTP‚Åªlike syntax

The first sample Dispatch may be represented in an HTTP-like notation like this:

```
GET /foods/pizza JSTP/0.4
host: pizza.com.ar
timestamp: 1365647440759
token: 3434h5098asr34h3

message: Let the cheese melt!
```

This notation may be used for clarity since raw JSON can be messy, for example it can be used in log files.
