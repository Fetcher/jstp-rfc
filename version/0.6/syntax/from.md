From Header
==============

The From Header is _optional_ and has the same structure in all three Morphologies.

The From Header `pair` key must be `from`, but as of the 0.5 version of JSTP, there are no constraints to what type of data is to be used in the `value`: any JSON `value` will do. It is recommended for the Referer Header to be used to convey information about the Emitter.
